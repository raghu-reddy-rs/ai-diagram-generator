I'll begin by analyzing the project to create a flowchart illustrating the relationships between its main components. First, I'll examine the `package.json` file to understand the project's dependencies and scripts, then I'll review `src/index.js` and `src/cli.js` to understand the application's logic. After my analysis, I'll provide a textual representation of the flowchart. I'll start with `package.json`.I've analyzed `package.json`: `src/cli.js` is the primary command-line entry point, using `commander`, `chalk`, `ora`, `fs-extra`, and `inquirer`. The scripts also point to `src/cli.js` and `src/setup.js`. Now, I'll examine `src/cli.js` and `src/index.js` to understand the application logic, starting with `src/cli.js`.Analyzed `src/cli.js`â€”it's the application's core. I'll review `src/index.js` for completeness, but `cli.js` appears to hold the primary logic.Analyzed `src/index.js`, confirming `src/cli.js` as the core. `cli.js` uses `commander` for `analyze`, `clone`, and `test` commands. `analyze` takes a path, clones git repos, uses a prompt, calls the `gemini` CLI, and saves the output. `clone` and `test` handle repo cloning and Gemini CLI connection testing, respectively. Helper functions manage prompts, git URLs, cloning, and running the `gemini` CLI. Here is the Mermaid.js flowchart visualizing these relationships:

```mermaid

    subgraph CLI Application (analyzer)
        B(src/cli.js)

        D[analyze command]

        F[test command]
    end

    end

    end

```
This flowchart illustrates the user's interaction with the CLI, the command structure, and the dependencies on external tools. You can view this code in a Mermaid.js compatible viewer to see the flowchart.
